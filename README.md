# VLSI-LAB-EXPERIMENTS
AIM: To simulate and synthesis Logic Gates,Adders and Subtractor using Xilinx ISE.

APPARATUS REQUIRED: Xilinx 14.7 Spartan6 FPGA

PROCEDURE: STEP:1 Start the Xilinx navigator, Select and Name the New project. STEP:2 Select the device family, device, package and speed. STEP:3 Select new source in the New Project and select Verilog Module as the Source type. STEP:4 Type the File Name and Click Next and then finish button. Type the code and save it. STEP:5 Select the Behavioral Simulation in the Source Window and click the check syntax. STEP:6 Click the simulation to simulate the program and give the inputs and verify the outputs as per the truth table. STEP:7 Select the Implementation in the Sources Window and select the required file in the Processes Window. STEP:8 Select Check Syntax from the Synthesize XST Process. Double Click in the Floorplan Area/IO/Logic-Post Synthesis process in the User Constraints process group. UCF(User constraint File) is obtained. STEP:9 In the Design Object List Window, enter the pin location for each pin in the Loc column Select save from the File menu. STEP:10 Double click on the Implement Design and double click on the Generate Programming File to create a bitstream of the design.(.v) file is converted into .bit file here. STEP:12 Load the Bit file into the SPARTAN 6 FPGA STEP:11 On the board, by giving required input, the LEDs starts to glow light, indicating the output.

Logic Gates:
module logicgates(a,b,andgate,orgate,xorgate,nandgate,norgate,xnorgate,notgate);
input a,b;
output andgate,orgate,xorgate,nandgate,norgate,xnorgate,notgate;
and(andgate,a,b);
or(orgate,a,b);
xor(xorgate,a,b);
nand(nandgate,a,b);  
nor(norgate,a,b);
xnor(xnorgate,a,b);
not(notgate,a);
endmodule


Half Adder:

module half_adder(a,b,sum,carry);
input a,b;
output sum,carry; 
or(sum,a,b);
and(carry,a,b);
endmodule


Full adder:

module fa_ha(a,b,c,sum,cout);
input a,b,c;
output sum,cout;
wire wl, w2, w3, w4, w5;
xor x1(w1,a,b);
xor x2 (sum,w1,c) ;
and al(w2,a,b) ;
and a2(w3,b,c);
and a3(w4,a,c) ;
or o1(w5,w2,w3) ;
or o2(cout,w5,w4) ;
endmodule


Half Subtractor:

module halfsubtractor( D,Bo,A,B);
input A,B;
output D,Bo;
wire w1;
xor (D,A,B);
not (w1,B);
and (Bo,B,w1);
endmodule
